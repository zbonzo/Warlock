# Warlock Game Server

A Node.js/Socket.IO server for the multiplayer Warlock game, featuring real-time gameplay, character abilities, status effects, and game state management.

## Architecture Overview

The server follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Game configuration and balance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/      # Socket event handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/       # Validation and request processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/           # Game entities and business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/         # High-level game services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/            # Utility functions and helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/           # Shared validation logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/           # REST API endpoints
```
