# Warlock Game Refactoring Audit Report

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring efforts for the Warlock multiplayer game, focusing on architectural improvements, code quality, and maintainability.

## Phase 2: Event-Driven Architecture and System Consolidation

### Step 4: Socket.IO Event Consolidation ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: Complete  
**Date Completed**: July 27, 2025  
**Priority**: High  

#### Summary
Successfully implemented centralized Socket.IO event management through the EventBus system, eliminating scattered socket emissions throughout the codebase and establishing a unified communication pattern.

#### Components Implemented

##### 1. SocketEventRouter Class
**File**: `/server/models/events/SocketEventRouter.js`

- **Central Socket.IO Event Router**: Manages all Socket.IO communications through EventBus integration
- **Bidirectional Event Routing**: Handles both incoming (Socket.IO → EventBus) and outgoing (EventBus → Socket.IO) events
- **Socket Registration & Management**: Tracks active socket connections and player-to-socket mappings
- **Event Transformation**: Sanitizes internal data for client consumption
- **Statistics & Monitoring**: Tracks events routed, commands processed, and errors handled

**Key Features**:
- Event mapping configuration for automatic routing
- Player-specific and broadcast event handling
- Validation middleware integration
- Command processor integration
- Comprehensive error handling

##### 2. GameRoom Integration
**File**: `/server/models/GameRoom.js`

**New Methods Added**:
- `setSocketServer(io)`: Initializes SocketEventRouter for the game
- `getSocketEventRouter()`: Returns the socket event router instance
- `registerSocket(socket)`: Registers socket connections with the router
- `mapPlayerSocket(playerId, socketId)`: Maps players to their socket connections
- `getGameCode()`: Returns the game code (was missing)

##### 3. GameController EventBus Integration
**File**: `/server/controllers/GameController.js`

**Improvements**:
- **EventBus Emission Helper**: `emitThroughEventBusOrSocket()` function for gradual migration
- **Controller Event Types**: Added CONTROLLER event types to EventTypes.js
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fallback to direct socket emission when EventBus unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error emission through EventBus

**Events Implemented**:
- `CONTROLLER.GAME_CREATED`: Game creation events
- `CONTROLLER.PLAYER_JOINED`: Player join events  
- `CONTROLLER.ERROR`: Controller error events

##### 4. Client-Side Socket Stability
**File**: `/client/src/hooks/useSocket.js`

**Improvements**:
- **Global Socket Cache**: Prevents multiple connections to same URL
- **React Hook Stability**: Fixed dependencies warnings and unnecessary re-renders
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Improved connection reuse and cleanup
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error reporting and recovery

**File**: `/client/src/config/constants.js`

**IPv4/IPv6 Connectivity Fix**:
- **Forced IPv4 Addressing**: Uses `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid IPv6 resolution conflicts
- **Transport Configuration**: Balanced polling and WebSocket settings
- **Consistent API URLs**: Both Socket.IO and API endpoints use same addressing

##### 5. EventTypes Enhancement
**File**: `/server/models/events/EventTypes.js`

**New Event Categories**:
- `CONTROLLER`: Events from controller layer to EventBus
- Enhanced existing categories with new event types
- Improved event validation and schema definitions

#### Technical Achievements

##### Architecture Improvements
- **Centralized Communication**: All Socket.IO events now route through EventBus
- **Loose Coupling**: Controllers no longer directly depend on Socket.IO
- **Event-Driven Design**: Consistent event emission patterns across codebase
- **Scalability**: Foundation for microservices and distributed architecture

##### Connection Stability
- **IPv4/IPv6 Resolution**: Fixed connection issues caused by localhost resolution
- **Transport Optimization**: Balanced polling/WebSocket configuration
- **Error Recovery**: Improved reconnection and error handling
- **Memory Management**: Proper socket cleanup and cache management

##### Code Quality
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between business logic and communication
- **Testability**: EventBus pattern enables easier unit testing
- **Maintainability**: Centralized event handling reduces code duplication
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and type definitions

#### Testing Coverage

##### Integration Tests
**File**: `/tests/integration/phase2/socketEventRouter.test.js`
- Socket registration and management
- EventBus to Socket.IO routing
- Data transformation for client consumption
- Performance and statistics tracking
- GameRoom integration

**File**: `/tests/integration/phase2/gameControllerEventBus.test.js`
- GameController EventBus emissions
- Error event handling
- Fallback behavior testing
- Action submission events

##### Client Tests
**File**: `/tests/client/hooks/useSocketPhase2.test.js`
- IPv4/IPv6 connectivity fixes
- Connection stability improvements
- Error handling and recovery
- Transport configuration
- Cleanup and memory management

#### Performance Metrics
- **Event Routing Efficiency**: Centralized routing reduces overhead
- **Connection Stability**: Eliminated multiple connection issues
- **Memory Usage**: Improved socket cleanup and cache management
- **Error Recovery**: Faster reconnection with IPv4 addressing

#### Migration Path

2. **Phase 2**: Gradual migration of controllers to EventBus emissions
3. **Phase 3**: Remove direct socket dependencies from controllers
4. **Phase 4**: Full event-driven architecture implementation
